    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "There are a lot of stereotypes surrounding college students and food. Students are busy and poor and therefore not good eaters - always eating fast food, takeout, and instant ramen. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>If this is true, then do restaurants around colleges reflect this? Are the restaurants around colleges cheaper on average than the area around them? Are there more \"junk food\" restaurants, like fast food, pizza, or burger places? \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>We used Yelp API to look at restaurants near several colleges in Pittsburgh and restaurants around the city in general to compare price level and categories. Our hypotheis is that restaurants around colleges are cheaper and have a higher percentage of \"junk food\" restaurants and other categories of restaurants associated with college students (Asian, Mexican food etc). Then we are going to visualize our results with Bokeh, a Python visualization library.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>This project demonstrates how people can use API and data science to answer business questions. Specifically, it shows how businesses can use API like Yelp's API to do market or competitor research. It is easy to imagine a restaurant using techniques similar to the ones we employed to help them identify how to set a price level given their location, or assess competition in their category.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>And of course, we hope to help students figure out where to get cheap food :^)"

    "To investigate what potentially leads to different pricing of restaurants around and far from universities, we can analyze categories of these restaurant. We mainly focus on \"fast food\" restaurants, which in our hypothesis will decrease the overall pricing for a certain area. Also, we look at \"Asian\", \"Mexican\", \"Indian\" and \"Vegetarian\" foods to figure out if people surrounding univerisities have different preference for restaurants.\n",

For example, we not only have \"Fast Food\", but also get \"Burgers\", \"Pizza\", \"Sandwiches\", \"Hot Dogs\" and so on. Apparently, there is no way to exhaustly gain all the desired information if we solely count on string parsing with some keywords set by our imagination. To address this, we copied all restaurant categories from [Yelp all category list](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/all_category_list) in the excel file, labelled categories that we want to do further analysis on, and assigned new more straightforward class names to them.\n",

Data visualization can be a useful tool for exploring the results of a project like this, and we found it helped us to understand our learnings. Additionally, since our problem is practical, visualization will help us communicate our results in a way that's easy for any viewer to understand. \n",

Potential reasons for the price difference in this area could be that there are two big universities (CMU and PITT) close to each other, so many cheap restaurants are in this area. In contrast, the other schools are more spread out so the area around them may be less \"college town\"-ish and therefore less cheap."

In the previous analysis, we found out that, compared with control group, university areas (PITT, CMU, CAR) with higher percentages of fast food restaurants have lower price levels, while university areas (CCAC, DUQ, CHA, PPU) with relatively low percentages of fast food restaurants have price levels that are more expensive than the area far from it.

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "We found that surprisingly, our hypothesis was not totally correct. It is not necessarily true that restaurants around universities in Pittsburgh are cheaper than restaurants in Pittsburgh in general. However, we did find that price level of restaurants was correlated with percent of fast food restaurants around a university (higher percentages of fast food restaurants lead to lower price levels). We also found that universities with lower price level restaurants around them were concentrated in Oakland. We think that this is the case because there are two major universities (CMU, UPitt) close together in that area, where in other areas, the unversities are smaller or more spread apart.\n",

    "If we were to continue with our project, we could expand this question in the following ways:\n",
    "- Ask if this price and category difference holds for a larger sample size and extend the question to other cities besides Pittsburgh\n",
    "- Ask in general where the cheapest restaurants are in Pittsburgh\n",
    "- Ask if the size of the school/income level of students/tuition affects the price level of restaurants around a school\n",
    "- Ask if the demographics of a school affect the categories of restaurants (for example, does a school with a high percentage of Asian students have lots of Asian restaurants around it?)"
